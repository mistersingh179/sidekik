Mission of Step 1: Show UI for contract ✅

We need 2 things: ✅
- Contract Address ✅
- ABI ✅

user gives us json abi file(s) from anywhere ✅
we get contractName & abi from it. ✅
take any file and search for keys which match contract name & take address ✅
we show functions & their inputs from abi ✅
and run functions based on abi, inputs, contract address & provider ✅
