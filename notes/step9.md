# step 9: be able to persist contracts beyond network changes & session restarts


## feedback from blue taxi from toronto

- I'm curious, is there any way for contracts I put on here to be saved?
    - stored values should be scoped to the chain id
        - so localhost contracts, will load when you connect to localhost rpc again
        - and mainnet contracts will load when you connect to mainnet rpc again
- Everytime I refresh or disconnect metamask they dissapear which makes it kinda pointless.
- Using it for a live chain not for hardhat

## side item
- investigate ethbuilders.nyc
