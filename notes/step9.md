# step 9: make it do more

## features
- transfer & transferFrom, should be together
- convert boolean to dropdown with false selected
  - this will prevent errors
- faster way to enter data
  - save all input & output data to context cache
  - add option for dropdowns everywhere 
  - refactor address to use same pattern
  - build modal to select values from cache
  - make dropdowns driven from settings
- do signatures
  - many times when it wants bytes from signing something
  - able to type something in, have it signed & then be put in

## ui
- when things dont work developers go to dev tools
  - fix all messaging there
  - point them to docs from there

## from silvertongue

- how to fake things such as block.timestamp
- @MisterSingh - other future feature request -> can you give me ability to organize my functiosn in the order that I want too? and for that order to be saved - would be nice to prevent me from scrolling up and down unnecessarily while I'm testing
- > and another additional - most likely more important feature - the ability to create a "FLOW" => I can order transactions in a specific order with their placeholder / pre-determined inputs and trigger them, so that I don't have to click through A -> B -> C to see the result of C every time - unsure if that is clear?
