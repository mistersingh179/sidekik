## bug

- two files with same name cause clash of keys âœ…
  - rejecting two files with same name âœ…
  - rejecting two directories with same name âœ…
- can add two files with same name, this causes loop reading âœ…
  - the loop happened when files had different content âœ…
  - rejecting duplicate names solves the issue âœ…
- why so many getBalance calls, when syncing a directory? ðŸš§
  - we are fetching all balances when new contracts without addresses are added ðŸš§
  - it is calling even when abi comes in with no address ðŸš§
  - we are fetching all balances when a tx runs ðŸš§
- when names are same it keeps reading over & over âœ…
  - makes multiple calls to chain for balance & code âœ…
  - store path of file. âœ…
- every transaction leads to a bunch of getBalance calls
- when no network, it is reading every 1 second, and flashing the input contracts
- pending tx via metamask did not show spinner while tx was being mined
- unable to use on brave âœ…
- show message asking to use chrome âœ…
  - showOpenFilePicker does not work âœ…
  - showDirectoryPicker does not work âœ…
  - disable buttons which won't work âœ…
- not fetching abi when connected to metamask
- address field should either be editable or not be there âœ…
- shows continue button, when there is no address, just a contract
- fix name of worker file
- fix name of woker instance from instance to something else
- refactor contract missing messaging to be when chain - yes & contracts - no
- refactor processRpcUrl to have proper if statement for instance.current
- removing and adding directory does not read its files which were before removed.
  - seems like it still has cache even though it was removed.

### bug - slowness / performance issue when syncing directory

- we are using md5, will sh1 be faster
- read files in a worker thread âœ…
  - this is to not block UI when it is reading the disk âœ…
  - make 1 persistent worker for better performance âœ…
- change polling to be 2 seconds âœ…
- changed polling delay to be a gap after reading ended âœ…
- slow with whole directory loaded in âœ…
- ignore blank `[]` abi's when parsing. shows lots empty items when parsing complete directories âœ…
- ignoring abi files with empty abi and bytecodes for hardhat & foundry format âœ…

## bugs from silvertongue

- bytes can be set with empty value & internally uses 0x âœ…
- bytes32 can be set with empty value & internally uses 0x00..00 âœ…
- if a struct has an array show array âœ…
- set input array to empty value of `[]` was already âœ…
- set input number to be empty value âœ…
- set input string to be empty value âœ…
  - the field seems to be missing completely when there is no change âœ…
  - after a change we have emtpy string which works âœ…
  - maybe because there is no format, so it never handles change initially âœ…
- set bool to empty value âœ…
  - currently also missing as string since no format operator âœ…
- all fields but address should work when set to empty. âœ…
  - it should not error out as it is submitting their appropriate empty value âœ…
- When I try to pass in an empty array: [] as a bytes[] arguments, it returns an error for some reason âœ…
- That happens when I try to pass in the empty array as part of a struct, like Transaction for instance âœ…

## more from silvertongue

- how to fake things such as block.timestamp
- @MisterSingh - other future feature request -> can you give me ability to organize my functiosn in the order that I want too? and for that order to be saved - would be nice to prevent me from scrolling up and down unnecessarily while I'm testing
- > and another additional - most likely more important feature - the ability to create a "FLOW" => I can order transactions in a specific order with their placeholder / pre-determined inputs and trigger them, so that I don't have to click through A -> B -> C to see the result of C every time - unsure if that is clear?

## bugs from chillipaneer

> nice. sidekik looks like it will be awesome.
> I stuck with remix for something recently just because it made it easy to interact with the contracts on testnet.
> but it looks like the app is still being built.
> I can't upload a file or sync to a directory errror:Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: window.showOpenFilePicker is not a function
> polling of local server appears to still be happening even when connected with metamask
> and none of the contact links connect to anything
> let me know if I can help out with testing. It looks like a killer tool

## bugs from chillipaneer on live session

- auto remove space from pasted in contract address
- no paste in address dropdown
- address dropdown blur, removes the value
- the reason I use remix, because I get these functions UI. now i can switch to hardhat.
- overloaded functions dont work!!! âœ…

## feedback form austin

> put last used function on top
> preserve values
> show contract address on top
> re-run a tx

## more feedback from slivertongue

> when i switch out between contracts the inputs of the contract im switching out of disappear, would be great to keep them
> would be great to split the screen so i dont have to tab in and out

## more bugs from chillipaneer

> yeah. those buttons are working with chrome, but not with Brave, even with shields down.
> They're both constantly polling localhost:8545 even when metamask connected and RPC URL option is disabled
> have pinged you on twitter

## Extra feature request from silvertongue:

- I end up copy pasting a lot of the same variables when I am testing, so it would be great to have a way to 1. have variables ready in the drop down for certain parameters or 2. have them directly rendered into the input field so I don't have to go for a copy / paste of 10 arguments every time it reloads
  LMK if all that is clear.

## documentation

- update for truffle âœ…
- add path & fs to document for saveContractFile in hardhat âœ…
- also make sure name is correct for saveContractFile in hardhat âœ…

## refactor

- put error boundary around each row

## research

- can disappearing abi tell us, that there is a compile error.
  - in foundry file becomes empty when there is compilation error.
  -

## sidekik-notification

- use `osascript -e` to call `display notification` when there is a compile error

```
osascript -e 'display notification "hello world\! This is a longer message and we would like to see how is it going to be displayed." with title "Greeting" subtitle "More text"'
```
